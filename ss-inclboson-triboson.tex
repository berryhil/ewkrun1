One avenue for testing quartic gauge boson interactions is through
inclusive tri-boson production: $pp \to VV^{\prime}V^{\prime\prime}$
for $V= \gamma, W, Z$.  Using the Run 1 data sample, the triply heavy
such channels ($WWW, WWZ, WZZ, ZZZ$) are not accessible anywhere near
SM rates, due to their small 8 TeV cross sections and comparably large
multi-lepton backgrounds. The photonic channels do not suffer as much
from these problems, and sensitivity is at or near SM rates in Run 1. 

An ATLAS analysis~\cite{Aad:2015uqa} has found evidence for
$W\gamma\gamma$ production.  In this process, a $W$ is produced in the
hard quark scattering, and the two photons can originate from either
initial- or final-state radiation, or interaction with the $W$ via
triple or quartic gauge boson interactions.  Events are selected with
lepton $\pt > 20$ GeV, $\met > 25$ GeV, $m_T > 40$ GeV and two photons
with $\pt > 20$ GeV.  Minimum angular separations between the lepton
and photons are also required to reduce the contribution of
final-state radiation amplitudes, which do not probe gauge boson
interactions.  This selection results in 157 events in the 8 TeV data.
Roughly half of these events are backgrounds: $W$ or $W\gamma$ plus
jets production with jets misidentified as photons, $Z\gamma$ events
with leptons misidentified as photons, or $\gamma\gamma$ plus jets
events with jets misidentified as leptons.  The backgrounds are
estimated for electron and muon events separately via template fits to
photon isolation distributions in data ($W$ or $W\gamma$ plus jets) or
lepton isolation distributions in data ($Z\gamma$ or $\gamma\gamma$
plus jets).

The diphoton invariant mass distributions of selected events, along
with estimated backgrounds, are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ss-inclboson-triboson-wgg-atlas8tev}.  A signal excess
is observed in both lepton channels, corresponding to a combined
significance larger than 3$\sigma$.  The fiducial production cross
section is estimated for both the inclusive case and an exclusive
selection with a jet veto for jets with $\pt > 30$ GeV, similar to the
ATLAS $W\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ analysis.  The measured inclusive cross
section, $6.1^{+1.1}_{−1.0} \rm{(stat.)} \pm 1.2 \rm{(syst.)} \pm
0.2 \rm{(lumi.)}$ fb, is 1.9$\sigma$ higher than a NLO prediction from
MCFM of $2.90\pm 0.16$ fb.  The exclusive cross section,
$2.9^{+0.8}_{−0.7} \rm{(stat.)} ^{+1.0}_{−0.9} \rm{(syst.)} \pm
0.1 \rm{(lumi.)}$ fb, agrees with the MCFM prediction of $1.88\pm
0.20$ fb.  A similar phenomenon was observed in the $W\gamma/Z\gamma$
analysis, where it is believed missing higher order corrections to the
inclusive cross section are substantial.  Systematic uncertainties for
these cross sections are predominantly from the data-driven background
estimation methods.

The exclusive $W\gamma\gamma$ event yield at high diphoton mass
($m_{\gamma\gamma} > 300$ GeV) is used to obtain 95\% CL bounds on
dimension 8 EFT couplings $f_{T,0}$ and
$f_{M,(2,3)}$~\cite{Eboli:2006wa}.  For the case of no unitarizing
form factor, the observed limit on $|f_{T,0}/\Lambda^4|$ is 90
TeV$^{-4}$.  For a unitarizing form factor with a cutoff scale of 600
GeV, these limits are relaxed by up to a factor of 8.

CMS has performed a search for $WV\gamma$ production in 8 \TeV\;
data~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014bza}, where $V$ is a hadronically decaying
$W$ or $Z$ boson.
