%Physics motivation
With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012~\cite{Chatrchyan201230, Aad20121} 
the standard model of particle physics
seemed complete, but fundamental questions remaine to be answered, as for example about the
constituents of dark matter, the relative abundance of matter over anti-matter, 
and the unification of forces at the Planck scale. 

%EWK precision measurements
Precision measurements in the electro-weak sector allow to test the validity of 
various extensions of the standard model. In the framework of anomalous gauge couplings
and it's reformulation as effective field theory the standard model can be extended
with additional generic terms in the lagrangian to describe new physics. The 
measurement of electroweak production processes allows to verify the validity 
of the standard model in this framework at the high collision energies the LHC
is providing.

% photon structure and benchmark perturbative QCD
Beside eletroweak measurements, the proton-proton collisions at the LHC provide a rich testing ground to 
benchmark perturbative QCD over a wide range of scales, and to determine the structure
of the proton. Both are essential ingredients to make precise eletroweak measurements, as higher order
corrections in perturbative QCD have a substantial effect on the theoretical predictions to 
standard model processes, and the knowledge of the proton structure becomes a major uncertainty
for processes with very high partonic centre of mass, i.e. the region where we expect new physics
to become visible.

%LHC and detectors
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was designed to search for the Higgs boson and
new phenomena. 

%LHC machine
The LHC collides protons on protons in a circular ring of 27\;km 
circumference and can reach an energy of up to $7\TeV$ per beam, and a collision
energy at the centre-of-mass of up to $\rts=14\TeV$. 

%Detectors
The two general purpose detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, are able to
record a wide range of physics process. They differ in the technical details of detector
layout and data-acquisition design but have common design goals, namely 
good detector coverage for charged and neutral particles, excellent resolution to measure
the positions and momenta of charged particles, and precision calorimetry. The other two
main experiments at the LHC are optimized for recording collision of heavy ions in the 
case of ALICE or for precision measurements of b-hadrons and CP violation (LHC-b).

%outline
In the following we will briefly review the electroweak physics programme at the LHC (section~\ref{ss-lhc-physics}),
followed by an overview of theory developments (section~\ref{s-theory-overview}), and a comprehensive
summary of the electroweak results from ATLAS and CMS on inclusive vector boson production in section~\ref{s-inclusboson} 
and electroweak precision tests in section~\ref{s-ewk-prec-tests}.
