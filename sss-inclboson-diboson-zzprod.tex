\subsubsection{ZZ production}
\label{sss-ZZprod}

%short intro
The production of \ZZ in proton-proton collisions has been one of the first di-boson 
processes measured at the LHC. The SM process is and an important and irreducible
background to resonance searches and Higgs production. The production at leading
order is dominated by quark anti-quark annihilation in the $t$ and $u$-channel,
whereas the $s$-channel process is forbidden in the SM 
(see also Figure~\ref{fig:sss-ZZprod-LOdiagrams}). The gluon fusion process 
contributes about 6\% to the total production cross section.

%decay channels
Precision measurements use the leptonic decay modes of the $Z$ to reduce the impact of
QCD backgrounds. 
The four lepton final state provides an almost background free signature, at the
expense of a relatively small branching ratio 
$BR(ZZ) \to \ll\ll = 0.101^2 \cdot {4 \over 9} = 0.0045$~\cite{PDG}.  
The di-lepton and missing energy channel can exploit the one order of magnitude
higher branching ratio of 
$BR(\ZZ \to \ll\vv) = 0.101 \cdot 0.20 \cdot 2 \cdot {2 \over 3} = 0.0269$, 
at the expense of high background levels.

The ATLAS collaboration has published results on the $7\TeV$ data-set 
in the $\ll\ll$ and $\ll\vv$ final state~\cite{Aad:2012awa}. The CMS collaboration
has analysed the full 7 and $8\TeV$ data sets in both 
the $\ll\ll$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012sga,Khachatryan:2014dia} and 
$\ll\vv$ final state~\cite{Khachatryan:2015pba}.

% NLO alpha_EKW arXiv:1305.5402,arXiv:1307.4331
Theoretical predictions for $\ZZ$ production are available 
at NLO in $\alpha_s$~\cite{arXiv:1105.0020}. In addition, electroweak 
corrections at NLO have been calculated~\cite{arXiv:1305.5402,arXiv:1307.4331}. 

% Z->llll
%Selections
The event selection for the $\ll\ll$ final state requires exactly four leptons 
fulfilling a set of cuts on kinematic quantities. ATLAS and CMS use similar criteria 
as listed in detail in Table~\ref{tab:sss-ZZprod-cuts}. While ATLAS uses $l=e,\mu$,
CMS includes also $\Z\to\tautau$ with subsequent hadronic and leptonic $\tau$
decays. ATLAS uses in addition forward leptons outside the ID tracker
to increase the acceptance by 6\% for electrons and 10\% for muons.
%Backgrounds
The $\ll\ll$ channels offers the cleanest event sample with a background level
of only $2-3\%$ from $\Z+jets$, $\tt$, and di-boson events. 
The background is estimated from data by control regions with looser selection
criteria. 

% Z->llvv
%Selections
Events in the $\ll\vv$ final state are characterized by exactly two leptons 
and missing energy. The event selection requires a leptonic $\Z$ candidate and
missing energy in the event. Both experiments used refined observables of
missing energy with additional information to improve the rejection 
against instrumental background. 
%Backgrounds 
The background level is in the same order
as the signal and substantially higher then for $\ll\ll$ .
Main background sources are $\V+jets$, $\tt$ and di-boson production. 
ATLAS and CMS use data driven techniques to constrain the 
dominant background sources.

% Results at the end?
% xsec
Besides the total cross section for the $pp \to \ZZ$ production process, both
experiments measure also fiducial and differential cross sections. The results are 
summarized in Tabel~\ref{tab:sss-ZZprod-cross-sections}. ATLAS and CMS
use different definitions of the fiducial phase space which needs to be taken into
account to make a direct comparison is possible.
For the total cross section a slightly different mass range for the $\Z$ mass range is
used, where CMS uses a wider range of $60\GeV < \mZ < 120\GeV$ then ATLAS with 
$76\GeV < \mZ < 116\GeV$, which contributes to the difference in the quoted predicted
cross section. Agreement of experimental and theoretical cross section 
values is observed.

Limits on ATGC parameters are determined with differential distributions of the 
invariant di-boson mass (CMS, four lepton channel), 
the transverse momentum of the leading lepton (CMS, $\ll\vv$-channel), or
the transverse momentum of the leading \Z (ATLAS, all channels).
A comparison of the measured and predicted differential cross sections in the 
four-lepton invariant mass is shown from CMS in Figure \ref{fig:sss-inclboson-diboson-zzprod-zzinvmass}.
Also shown is the prediction in the presence of a non-zero value of the anomalous coupling
parameter $f_4^Z=0.015$, which shows an enhancement over the SM value at high 
invariant masses.

Both experiment publish 95\% CL limits on ATGC without form factors in the $\ll\ll$ 
and $\ll\vv$ channels. The results are in agreement with the SM and 
summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:sss-inclboson-diboson-zzprod-aTGC_naTGCf} 
taken from Ref. \cite{aTGCplots}. The precision of the LHC results is driven by the steep increase of 
sensitivity with higher centre-of-mass energy
and are about 2 orders of magnitude better compared to the 
combined LEP result~\cite{LEP-comb-2002}.
